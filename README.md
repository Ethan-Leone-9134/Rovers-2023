# Rovers
Welcome, this is the RIT Spex Rover Pi Github. This is the code (as of 4/16/23) that controls the rover.
Depending on the active functions, the pi takes inputs from either a predetermined program or an xbox controller.
It then sends those inputs to the pins on the pi and sends a kill code upon termination.
The terminal is designed to give outputs for all connections, signals, and disconnections.
